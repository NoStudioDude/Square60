Square_60
=========

Much like the game TwoDots. Try to make chains of the same color by clicking and swiping over the squares

Make Square shapes swipes to remove all squares of the same color.
Use the bottom powerups to get an advantage over the 60 seconds limit.

Try to make as many points as possible under 1 minute.


Most of the code is really not that optimized. This was the first game I actually finished.
