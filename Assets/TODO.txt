TODO LIST:

In Game:
	1 - Change timer. Instead display a bar that goes down.
	2 - Power-ups will be given depending on how good the player is doing.
		If doing bad, give some help, if doing good, give less goodies.
	3 - Leaderboard (google/facebook)
	4 - Facebook integration for sharing
	
UI:
	1 - GET A FUCKING ICON FOR THE GAME!! LOL
	2 - Make the tutorial button nicer (it fucking suck as it is now)..
